EDA Portfolio Project (AeroFit Treadmill Buyer Analysis) 
📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on AeroFit treadmill sales data to identify key customer characteristics influencing treadmill purchases. The goal is to derive actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies and sales performance.

🎯 Key Objectives
✅ Analyze customer demographics (age, income, fitness level, marital status).
✅ Identify purchase trends across different treadmill models.
✅ Detect correlations and outliers in the dataset.
✅ Calculate conditional probabilities to understand buying patterns.
✅ Provide data-driven recommendations for product marketing.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
📌 Programming Language: Python
📌 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy
📌 Dataset: AeroFit Treadmill Sales Data (aerofit_treadmill_data.xlsx)

📊 Analysis Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Preprocessing – Checking for missing values, duplicates, and data structure.
2️⃣ Statistical Analysis – Generating summary statistics for numerical & categorical variables.
3️⃣ Graphical Analysis – Using histograms, boxplots, and pairplots for data visualization.
4️⃣ Correlation & Outlier Detection – Identifying relationships and anomalies in data.
5️⃣ Conditional Probability Analysis – Evaluating product purchase probabilities based on customer attributes.
6️⃣ Actionable Insights & Recommendations – Providing strategic suggestions to optimize sales.

📈 Key Findings
✔ Most buyers are aged 20-30 years and prefer the KP281 model.
✔ High-income customers ($70K+) don’t always opt for premium models.
✔ Fitness-conscious buyers are more likely to purchase KP781.
✔ Males & partnered customers dominate treadmill purchases.

📢 Actionable Recommendations
🎯 Targeted Marketing – Advertise KP781 to high-income, fitness-conscious buyers.
💰 Sales Promotions – Offer EMI plans, discounts, and loyalty programs to boost sales.
🔍 Data Quality Improvement – Clean outliers and implement AI-based customer segmentation.

🚀 Future Scope
📊 Implement predictive modeling to forecast future sales trends.
🎯 Develop a recommendation system for treadmill buyers based on user profiles.

✅ This project provides data-driven insights to help AeroFit optimize sales and marketing strategies effectively! 🚀
